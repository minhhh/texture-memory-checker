# unity-test-texturemem

This app will allow you to add 2048x2048 textures one by one and see how much memory your program consumes, as well as its current FPS. You'll have a general idea based on how much maximum memory your program should have, how many 2048x2048 sheets (or equivalence) it should draw at any scene.
